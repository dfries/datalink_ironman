# Processor frequency.
#   Normally the first thing your program should do is set the clock prescaler,
#   so your program will run at the correct speed.  You should also set this
#   variable to same clock speed.  The _delay_ms() macro uses this, and many
#   examples use this variable to calculate timings.  Do not add a "UL" here.
